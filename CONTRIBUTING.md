# Contributing Guide

## Reporting Issues

`fsf-api` has a [project page on GitHub](https://github.com/spdx/fsf-api) where you can [create an issue](https://github.com/spdx/fsf-api/issues/new/choose) to report a bug, make a suggestion, or propose a substantial change or improvement that you might like to make.
You may also wish to contact the SPDX working group technical team through its mailing list, [spdx-tech@lists.spdx.org](mailto:spdx-tech@lists.spdx.org).

If you would like to work on a fix for any issue, please assign the issue to yourself prior to creating a Pull Request.

## Submitting Pull Requests

The `master` branch of this repository contains [the pulling script](pull.py) and associated documentation.
Please review [open pull requests](https://github.com/spdx/fsf-api/pulls) and [active branches](https://github.com/spdx/fsf-api/branches) before committing time to a substantial revision.
Work along similar lines may already be in progress.

To submit a pull request via GitHub, fork the repository, create a topic branch from `master` for your work, and send a pull request when ready.
If you would prefer to send a patch or grant access to pull from your own Git repository, please contact the project's contributors by email.

## Signing Your Changes

Git has built-in support for signing off: `git commit -s` signs a current commit, and `git rebase --signoff <revision-range>` retroactively signs a range of past commits.
